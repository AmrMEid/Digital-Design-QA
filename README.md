# Digital-Design-Recap

Hi All , 

maybe you curious what will you find in this repository about digital design? the answer is simple, Nothing New.

Sometimes when you need to look back for some simple concepts or definitions but digging in different resources and books maybe for someone painful.
therfore I use this this repo to put all information about specific topic in same page.this make it easier to search. 

I often visit this repository when need to recap some concepts or study for technical interview so I hope it is a helpful for you too.

I keep the refernces that I used to develop this article in the end of every topic so when you need to gain more information and look for the science behind my answer,
you can easily go througth these books' names and articles.

I will continue update this repository with more figures to elaborate better or with some new topics so please visit the changes.log to see the edits history.

May the odds be ever in your favor

Thank you.
